  - question: Should I use the relay-proxy or the GO SDK?
    answer: |
      It is up to you, the GO SDK is where the magic happen, and it avoid to call the relay-proxy for every flag evaluation.
      BUT it is compatible only in your GOlang project, the advantage of the relay-proxy is that you can use it with all the languages.

  - question: Where do I find GO Feature Flag SDKs?
    answer: |
      GO Feature Flag believe in standardization, that's why we are not developing any SDK and we rely only on Open-feature for this part.
      Our providers will call the relay-proxy to do the evaluation for you.
      This is still work in progress since Open-feature is a new thing, but our goal is to be compatible with all languages supported.
