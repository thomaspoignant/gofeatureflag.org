# ğŸ”Š Feature Flags in Devâ€™Obs Podcast ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·

Earlier this week the super cool podcast Devâ€™Obs asked me to talk about feature flags, go-feature-flag and also the super nice initiative Open-feature.

The podcast is in French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· (yes I know sorryâ€¦) but you can learn a lot of cool things, when to use them, what is Open-feature about and all the cool things that the feature flags can bring to your developer experience.
